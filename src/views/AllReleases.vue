          <h4 class="releaseTitleAll">DUALISM (2021)</h4>
          <p>Luigi has been involved in the writing process of the eight tracks included in this latest release of the band during  which an intense collaboration and exchange of ideas happened with the other four members of TFB. At the rehearsal room based in Haggerston, London U.K. the band managed to put together their work by the end of 2018. This process was filled with excitement to have created some very interesting tracks and the band felt the  need to  share them with the public. This culminated into a 1 day live recording session at the beautiful “The Pool” Studios (MIloco) in London in early 2019 with Ben Thackeray (Ben’s previous clients include Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, My Bloody Valentine, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Supergrass, Engineers, Steve Mason, Jamie Cullum and Rachel Zeffira) engineering the recordings. Subsequently the album was mixed by the producer Drew Nix in New York, U.S.A. Following the release of the five singles and music videos for " Out Of The Maze", "Motorik", "Let's Bop", "Desert Caravan", "Faraday Cage", “Dualism” came out on the September 10th 2021 with a great release concert at Colours, Hoxton in London.

          <p>This is the very first of many collaborations    that Luigi has done with the Blues/rock Singer songwriter Ben Hemming. As a session drummer He arranged the drum parts for this album that has seen Ben Hemming’s writing approach changing ever since. Ben comes from a Blues/folk/Americana musical background but this release was the first of many in a Blues Rock style. The drum parts recordings happened at the Blue Studios in London during a five days session with Marc Waterman ( previous works include Depeche Mode, Elastica, Ash, Ride and many more) at the desk and Nick Terry (engineer/producer with mix credits to his name ranging from bands such as The Libertines, Primal Scream and The Klaxons to full electronic artists such as Simian Mobile Disco) who took care of the mixing.

          <h4 class="releaseTitleAll">SUPERBLOOD WOLFMOON PREDICTION</h4>
          <p>Following the touring phase as a member of the band, Luigi has also been part of this release conceived as a brilliant idea by Francesco D’andrea (BMA lead guitarist, soundtracks composer). He thought to release a “prediction” song to the Pearl Jam single “Superblood Wolfmoon” following the release of a snippet of one of the song guitar riffs by the band on YouTube.
After receiving a phone call from Francesco, Luigi only had one and a half days to write and record the drum parts as the actual Pearl Jam single was set to be released 3 days later. With all the other instrumental and vocal parts recorded and mixed in the following day, Black Market aftermath released this “Prediction” song on Youtube on the 16th of February 2020. The track has received an incredibly great response amongst the band followers and Pearl Jam fans with over 36k views on youtube and a day later it was dedicated a reaction video by  Enrico Silvestrin ( Former MTV VJ and actor ) on his renowned YouTube channel called “Perfette sconosciute”.
